We are only briefly describing the main steps in computing hardware, limiting ourself to _modern_ computing hardware, i.e. digital computers, and focus on how they can/could be accessed and used.
We heavily rely on [Wikipedia: History of computing hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware) for this section.

Before we start, [computer history museum](https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/) has an excellent timeline starting in 1937 with a relay based adder and ending in 2015 with the Apple Watch - [you can for sure run doom on it](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-02-17). 

## Basics

The principal concept of _modern computers_ was introduced by [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) when he reformulated [Kurt GÃ¶dels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) results and introduced the [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).

This was the basis for the first electromechanical computers that started developing during World War II.
Most notably the devices developed in Bletchley Park by Alan Turing called _bombs_, used to decrypt the messages from Enigma.
All of these devices mainly performed logical operations on the input that was set by hand.
If you wanted something else to be done, you needed to rebuild/reconfigure the hardware.
These machines where not [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), i.e. not general purpose.
The machines where also electromechanical (electric switches and mechanical relays.)


The machine getting the title for Turing-complete is from [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse) that developed _the world's first working electromechanical programmable, fully automatic digital computer_, the [Z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)).
Already with a lot of similarities to machines we know, one example being that it had floating-point numbers.

As input for these machines punched-cards or tapes (first used for weaving) where used to set the input variables.

The first stored-program computer was the [_Manchester Baby_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby) and it is also said to be the first (working) machine that contains all the essential elements of what know as computer.
It was still somewhat cumbersome to program but you did not need to rearrange the internal wiring.
