# High Performance Computing

## Overview

High Performance Computing (HPC) is a particular branch on what we here call _Remote Computing_.
As the name suggest, the focus is on **high performance** in the sense that it tries to aggregate as much computing power as possible and therefore allow computations that would otherwise not be possible with a single smartphone, workstation, or server. 
In theory, it is exactly the same as _normal_ computing, just with significant more power.
In practice, these systems are designed in a certain way and working with them needs some getting used to.
Therefore, we will do a bit of a hands on so that next time you see an HPC System you are a bit faster working with it.
