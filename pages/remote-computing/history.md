# History

While it would be worth while and fun to got through the entire list of 
- [computing hardware before 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computing_hardware_before_1950)
- [computing hardware after 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware_(1960s%E2%80%93present))
on Wikipedia, we need to limit ourself. 

We are only briefly describing the main steps in computing hardware, limiting ourself to _modern_ computing hardware, i.e. digital computers, and focus on how they can/could be accessed and used. 

Before we start, [computer history museum](https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/) has an excellent timeline starting in 1937 with a relay based adder and ending in 2015 with the Apple Watch - [you can for sure run doom on it](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-02-17). 

\note{

An error in a program or **bug** is named after the common problem that bugs would prevent relays from switching. So yes it used to be actual üêõ that caused errors, [reference](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/).
