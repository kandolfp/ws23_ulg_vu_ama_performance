# History

While it would be worth while and fun to got through the entire list of 
- [computing hardware before 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computing_hardware_before_1950)
- [computing hardware after 1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware_(1960s%E2%80%93present))
on Wikipedia, we need to limit ourself. 

We will do this in pictures and some explanation/interactive session with a very subjective list, so if you are reading this at a later point please have a look at [computer history museum](https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/) where most images
from.

\note{
An error in a program or **bug** is named after the common problem that bugs would prevent relays from switching. So yes it used to be actual üêõ that caused errors, [reference](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/).
