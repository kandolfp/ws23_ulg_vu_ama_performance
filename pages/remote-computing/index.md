# Remote Computing
\toc

In this section we discuss _Remote Computing_, which for the purpose of this class is everything you are not computing on your local machine. 
We will have a special focus on **High Performance Computing** (HPC) but also look at differences to **Cloud compting** and other possibilities to offload computational work. 

In order to get a better understanding on what the differences are, how they work together and whatnot we start by a short history of computing.
